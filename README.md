# Damage Stability Simulator

This project simulates ship stability by plotting the GZ (righting arm) curve under both intact and damaged conditions.

### Features
- Computes GZ using basic naval architecture formulas
- Simulates stability reduction after flooding (raised KG)
- Plots GZ vs heel angle up to 60Â°
- Very lightweight, runs instantly

### How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
